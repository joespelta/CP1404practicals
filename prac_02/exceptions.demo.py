CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?
"""

try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    fraction = numerator / denominator
    print(fraction)
except ValueError:
    print("Numerator and denominator must be valid numbers!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
print("Finished.")


# 1. The ValueError will occur when a number given is a decimal, or not a number at all.

# 2. The ZeroDivisionError will occur a '0' is entered into the denominator section.

# 3. TODO: As of right now i am unsure of question 3
